#User-defined model inputs.
#Designed for the user to edit the values below to change the simulation.


#Spatial and temporal domain
L = 20.0        #Length of model in metres
T = 300.0       #Length of test in seconds

#Spatial and temporal resolution
dx = 0.2        #in metres
dt = 10.0       #in seconds

#Velocity of the stream
u = 0.1         #in metres per second

#Initial pollutant concentration at x = 0 - boundary condition
